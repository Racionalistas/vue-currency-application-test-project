# currency-application

## Project description
The uploaded site: http://z99589w6.beget.tech/

### Motivation
I had to realize the project as a test task for a vacancy. 

### Objective
The test task had following description:
"Page one: Converter from one currency to another. This page should have a field where you can enter text in the form of 15 usd in rub and get the result.
Page two: Page with current exchange rates. On this page, the user should see "fresh" exchange rates relative to the base currency - for example, if the base currency is the ruble, then the user sees that 1 USD = 63.49 RUB, and 1 EUR = 72.20"

## Development progress and notes
### Versions
The Russian version is stable, the English version will be released in the following update.

## Difficulties
Every step was very difficult to me, from rerendering issues to setting Vue compatibility with frameworks and receiving data from open currency API. 

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
